## ras-demo

This project is the implementation given at:

`http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/cryptography/rsa_encryption.shtml`

Project shows example to use Base64 encoding and decoding for sending and receiving the encrypted data.

 If do'nt find the class Base64, then include rt.jar [usually you find this class with in default jre library]

 Run `RSAKeyGenerator` class first to generate the public and private key, at your current directory

 Run `RSAEncDec` to see the encryption of sample string using public and decription of sample string using private key.
